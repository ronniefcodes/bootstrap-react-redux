## React/Redux Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for React/Redux applications, created off of `create-react-app`.

Includes:
1. `storybook` - for testing individual UI elements
2. `node-sass` - as a CSS precompiler, can be replaced with styled-components fairly easily if desired
3. `classnames` - helper function for creating classnames for react elements

#### Getting started

To get the app running locally, run the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

Once webpack has finished compiling, the app should be accessible from `localhost:3000`.
